- Fixed one-way stickiness in VCE levels

- Removed `createentity`'s color argument (6th argument is now enemy type)

- Fixed `ifvar()` not working with the less-than and greater-than operators, or their "or equal to" counterparts

- Fixed an infinite loop that could happen if you died while a 1x1 quicksand was in the process of crumbling in a vanilla level

- `togglepause(on/off)` - toggle opening the map or exiting playtesting through enter

- Large coins (10/20/50/100) now exist, and they give you a different amount of coins depending on which size they are. You can place these with Z/X/C/V
