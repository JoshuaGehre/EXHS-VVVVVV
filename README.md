This is a fork of VVVVVV Community Edition which itself is a fork of Terry Cavanagh's VVVVVV.

However the Community Edition has been discontinued, due to me starting to make a level for a contest in VCE and since I'd like to finish it I will do all remaining bugfixes within this fork.

The original repository for VVVVVV is located at [TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV).

The repository for VVVVVV Community Edition is located at [v6cord/VVVVVV-CE](https://github.com/v6cord/VVVVVV-CE).

Here is the [VVVVVV Discord server](https://discord.gg/Zf7Nzea).

VCE has some custom permissions granted by Terry Cavanagh these do not aply to this fork.
